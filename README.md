## Overview

This module installs the Oracle Instant Client, plus related tools, libraries
and SDKs.

This module does **not** include the Oracle binary packages. You must [download
these from Oracle's website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html)
and place them in a Yum repo which is accessible by your system.

## Usage

### `oracleinstantclient`

The main usage of this module is via the `oracleinstantclient` class, which installs packages
and handles a few extra bits required to make the Instant Client work.

#### `version`
Specify the version of Oracle Instant Client to install. This **must** match the packages you have
downloaded from Oracle and placed in a local Yum repo. Default: `12.2`

#### `devel`
Install the development package. Default: `false`

#### `jdbc`
Install the JDBC package. Default: `false`

#### `odbc`
Install the ODBC package. Default: `false`

#### `sqlplus`
Install the SQLPlus application package. Default: `false`

#### `tools`
Install the tools package. Default: `false`

#### `selinux`
Manage SELinux policies to allow Oracle Instant Client to work on RHEL. Default: `true`

#### `eplan`
Install `eplan` SQL script to enable `explain plan` usage in SQLPlus. Default: `false`

#### Example
This example shows all parameters with their default values.
